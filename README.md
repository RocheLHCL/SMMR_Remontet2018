# SMMR_Remontet2018

In this document readme.pdf, we present the R-code that allows reproducing the analysis of the case study (available in the supplementary material) of the following article:
Flexible and structured survival model for a simultaneous estimation of non-linear and non-proportional effects and complex interactions between continuous variables: performance of this multidimensional penalized spline approach in net survival trend analysis.

However:
-	due to copyright issues, we cannot provide the original real dataset. So, we provide one of the simulated datasets used in the simulation study on cervix uteri cancer data on 10,000 patients. The results may thus differ, to some extent, from those presented in the article.
-	For simplicity the PH model is not presented
